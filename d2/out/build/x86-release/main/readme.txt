The following are supplemental items/changes to the DESCENT II manual.
If you can find no information regarding a problem you're having,
Section 9 below lists several sources of DESCENT II support.

There is an online version of the manual provided on this CD.  To view it, 
open the folder 'Manual' found on the root of the CD.  If you do not 
already have Acrobat Reader installed on your system, you will need to run
the file 'AR32E30.EXE' to install it.  If you have Windows 3.1, you will 
need to run 'AR16E30.EXE' instead.  Once installed, just double-click 
on the file 'Descent2.pdf' to view it.

IMPORTANT NOTES FOR WINDOWS 95 USERS
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

This readme file pertains to the DOS version of Descent II.  If you 
wish to run Descent II under Windows95, you should install Descent II
fron within Win95.  To to this, insert your Descent II disk, and when
the autorun menu comes up, select "Install".  To manually bring up the
autorun menu, open up "My Computer", then double-click on the "Descent_ii"
CD icon.

USING PRINTSCREEN IN STEREO MODES
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Descent II uses the PrintScreen key to save screenshots from within the game.
Normally, these images are saved sequentially with the name "Screen00, 
Screen01, etc."  When playing in stereo modes, PrintScreen will save a
separate image for each eye. These images are also numbered sequentially, 
but are named "Left01" and "Right01" respectively. Please note that images 
saved in stereo are exactly half the height of the current resolution.
For example, grabbing an image in 320 x 200 mode will result in 2 images 
that are 320 x 100 each. 


CHANGES & CORRECTIONS
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
- On page 10 of the manual, the Options menu is said to contain sound
  volume sliders and other options.  These have all been moved into a
  Sound Effects & Music submenu found on the Options menu.

- In the Options/Sound menu, you can now enable/disable redbook music
  by using the Disable CD Music toggle.  Volume levels can be adjusted
  individually.

- On page 15 of the manual, the Always Show High-res Automap toggle was
  left out of the Toggles menu.  Enabling this will always run the Automap
  in 640x480 instead of the 320x200 default.

- On page 17 of the manual, the Guide-Bot menu key is mistakenly listed
  as SHIFT-F2.  The actual key is SHIFT-F4.

- On page 19 of the manual, the Cycle Primary/Secondary keys are mistakenly
  listed as DEL/,.  The actual keys are "," for Primary and "." for
  Secondary.

- On page 31 of the manual, the Flash Missile was not mentioned.  This
  missile will blind opponents with a bright flash of light.  When robots
  are hit with these missiles, they will become briefly disoriented and
  will be more vulnerable to attack.

- On page 41 of the manual, label #12 (the ProxBomb/SmartMine count) was
  not labeled on the screenshot.  This display appears in the lower right
  of the cockpit below the key displays.

- On page 46 of the manual, the Multiplayer section states the delay for
  incoming players to be accepted as 5 seconds.  The delay is actually 8
  seconds.

- On page 57 of the manual, the Bright Player Ships toggle was left out
  of the Start Netgame options.  When enabled, this will make the player
  ships brighter and easier to see in dark corridors.

- In the VR Headset controls section of the manual, the following changes
  were made to the keys:

     Alt+F5 [VR Reset]
        o On the CyberMaxx, toggles victor mode on/off
        o Centers the head tracking
        o Resets all stereoscopic parameters to default
     Alt+F9  [Decreases the interaxial separation]
     Alt+F10 [Increases the interaxial separation]

Netgame Info and User Queries 
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
When sitting on the Multiplayer/Join Netgame screen, you can now hit "I"
to get more detailed info on a netgame in progress.  This feature was added
after the manual went to print.  As of version 1.1 pressing the "U" key on
this screen will show a list of players in the game. You may disable name
sending from within a game by pressing f8 and typing "!names".

Multiplayer Rankings
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Version 1.1 of Descent II features a system that ranks players in 
multiplayer games based on their lifetime kill record.  Information is 
stored everytime you kill or get killed by someone.  The better you get, 
the higher your rank.  Rankings start at 'Cadet' and continue up to 
'Admiral'.  

You will advance to the next rank for every 375 kills that you score.  
However, if your lifetime efficiency is below 60% you will advance 
much more slowly, and the lower your efficiency the slower you'll advance.

If the "-norankings" command line switch is used your machine will not 
display rankings for any player.  However, your machine will still send your
pilots' rank to the other players in the game.

Moving players in team games
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

If you are the 'master' of a team netgame and you wish to move players
to other teams, press F8 and then type 'move:<player>' where <player> is 
the name of the person to be switched.  

Example: 
 move:Sirloin

Afterwards, if Sirloin was on the blue team he will be switched to the red
team, and vice versa.


CD/MIDI Track Advancing
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
Also undocumented in the manual is the use of ALT -/+ keys (ALT-minus and
ALT-plus).  Using these keys in the game will play the previous/next
redbook track on the CD.  If you're listening to MIDI music, it will
advance to the next level song. 


GuideBot & Markers
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
The GuideBot is now able to find markers you have placed.  Hitting SHIFT-2
twice will send him to marker #2, hit SHIFT-1 to find marker #1, etc.


the Strategy Guide
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
Descent II: The Official Strategy Guide is available from Prima Publishing.
To order, call 800-531-2343.  Also available at better bookstores and
multimedia outlets nationwide.


DESCENT II and Internet Head-to-Head Daemon (IHHD)
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
While playing Multiplayer DESCENT II through the IHHD software is possible,
it is not recommended.  The delay in packet delivery will almost
certainly lead to strange results.  You may see players jump around
suddenly, or even disappear for several seconds at a time.  You may also
witness players not dropping powerups when killed, staying cloaked too
long, or other unfavorable results.  See Section 8 for additional ideas
and suggestions.


DESCENT II and Novell's NETX
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
When playing network games, all players should either have NETX loaded 
or all players should not have NETX loaded.  If one player has NETX 
loaded and the other player doesn't, this will cause noticeable 
slowdowns and delays when starting netgames.


DESCENT II and OS/2
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
To get DESCENT II to run under OS/2, just increase your DPMI_MEMORY_LIMIT
to 8 megs or more.  Descent should then run perfectly with full sound.
If your joystick behaves strangely under OS/2 try using the "-JoyPolled"
command line option.  Keep in mind that DESCENT II does not officially
support OS/2.


DESCENT II and Windows 3.1x
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
Use the following settings in your PIF file:

   Optional Parameters:  -JoyPolled
            EMS Memory:  KB Limit -1
            XMS Memory:  KB Limit -1
         Display Usage:  Full Screen
             Execution:  Exclusive

If you use a joystick, the -JoyPolled option uses an alternate method of
joystick reading that should increase performance under Windows.
Keep in mind that Descent does not officially support Windows.

ÈÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¼


THIEF-BOTS
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
Not all new robots are designed to help you.  Thief robots are fast and
evil robots, designed to steal your weaponry when you least expect it.
If you kill a Thief robot, he will drop items he has stolen from you.  If
he's stolen more than a few items, however, there is always the chance one
or two have been destroyed.


GUIDED MISSILES
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
Guided missiles can be a great weapon in any single- or multi-player game.
When you fire one of these, your pitch/bank controls will control the
flight path of the missile.  Remaining controls (throttle, sliding) will
still control your ship.  You will continue to control the Guided missile
until it runs out of fuel (30 seconds), it hits an object or wall, or until
you hit the fire key again (at which point the Guided missile will "home"
like a Homing missile).

By default, the Guided missile view will be displayed in the secondary
weapons display.  The view can be enlarged by using the appropriate toggle
in the Options/Toggles menu.


THE AFTERBURNER
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
New to the DESCENT II display is the Afterburner.  In Cockpit mode, the new
gauge appears as a red energy bar on the left side (the key display has been
moved to the right side).  This new energy bar will only activate if you
are currently carrying the Afterburner.  In Status Bar mode, it appears
below the main Energy Gauge.  In Full Screen, it appears as a percentage
above the Energy/Shield display on the left (if Afterburner is available).

The Afterburner uses a separate energy bank, which charges from your main
Energy.


AUTOSAVE/RESTORE BACKUPS
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
New in DESCENT II... When you save over an existing savegame, it will copy
the old one to a backup file.  This allows you to restore the old one in
case you accidentally overwrote it.  The backup game appears as
"[autosave backup]" at the bottom of the Restore Game list.

Likewise, whenever you Load a saved game, the game will save your current
game in the backup slot.  This will allow you to "undo" the restore in
case it was accidental.  Thank Mike for this welcome addition to DESCENT II!


BOMB DISPLAY
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
A new ProxBomb/SmartMine display has been added to your screen.  It appears
as a red or gold "B:xx" counter somewhere on your screen.  In Cockpit
mode, it appears in the lower right corner.  On the Status Bar, it's in the
lower left of the Secondary Weapons display.  In Full Screen, it's above
your current weapons display on the right.  If you have no ProxBombs or
SmartMines, this display will be blank.

This display tells you what weapon will be dropped when you hit the Drop
Bomb key (default is 'B').  If the display shows a red-colored "B:04" it
means you have four ProxBombs ready to be dropped.  A gold-colored display
indicates SmartMines.  Note that this does not indicate that the weapon is
"armed" as a Secondary weapon, and only refers to the Drop Bomb key
functionality. You may also assign a key of your choice to toggle between 
SmartMines and ProxBombs in the customize keyboard menu. 

NOTE: This display will reflect the ProxBomb/SmartMine positions in the
Secondary Autoselect Ordering menu, even if they appear below the "Never
Autoselect" line.  Example: Both ProxBombs and SmartMines appear below the
"Never" line, but ProxBombs appear higher.  The "B:xx" display will change
to ProxBombs over SmartMines if you have some of each.

                       ÈÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¼

Here are a few things that help new players adjust to the fully 3D world
and intelligent robots of DESCENT II.  Heed these tips and you'll soon be
blasting robot hordes (and your friends!) with ease.

     o Use a quality joystick.  Thrustmaster, Advanced Gravis, Logitech
       and CH Products provide full lines of controls well suited to 3D
       flying.

     o If you use a two-button joystick, try keeping one hand on the
       A and Z keys to control your FORWARD and REVERSE.

     o If you're up against a wall, try using REVERSE to back away 
       instead of turning around.

     o Learn how to SLIDE well.  Using vertical sliding instead of pitching
       will help keep you upright.  If your joystick has a Hat Switch, 
       use it to slide.

     o Rescue the hostages!  If you rescue all hostages in a mine, you
       receive a full rescue bonus.  But be sure you make it out after
       picking them up - if your ship's destroyed, so are they.

     o Try clearing a path to the exit before you attack the Main Reactor.
       You may run out of time if you're battling hordes of robots on
       your escape!

     o Look for secret doors.  Weapons and ammo are often behind them.                      
       They can be a different color, or have small seams running down
       them.  Keep in mind, DESCENT II is fully 3D, and secret doors aren't
       only in the walls...

     o DON'T SIT STILL.  The best way to stay alive is to keep moving.
       Using SLIDE to circle a target while you're firing is very
       effective.

     o Learn to use your ship's Automap.  It can reveal things your
       eyes may miss.

Thrustmaster, Gravis Phoenix, CH, and Logitech controls are fully supported
by DESCENT II.  The device control files (DESCENT2.ADV, DESCENT2.M50,
D2WCS.M50, D2TQS.M50, DESCENT.PHX, and DESCENT.KEY) can be found in the
\CONTROLS subdirectory.  If you have a Wingman Extreme, Flight Force Pro,
or other FCS-style stick, you should use the "Thrustmaster FCS" option.

      SpaceBall Avenger:  In the \CONTROLS subdirectory on your DESCENT II
                          CD there is a self-extracting zip file
                          (AVGRD2.EXE).  This archive contains the drivers
                          and instructions needed to use your Avenger with
                          DESCENT II.

       Thrustmaster FCS:  Choose "Thrustmaster FCS" under Options/Controls.
                          This is for players NOT using the WCS.  If you
                          use the WCS throttle with the FCS, follow
                          instructions for the WCS below.

     * Thrustmaster WCS:  Load the DESCENT2.ADV file into your WCS.  In
           Mark II        DESCENT II, choose "Joystick" under
                          Options/Controls.  Now choose "Configure Above"
                          and change the THROTTLE entry to respond to the
                          WCS (the Y2 axis).

    * Thrustmaster FLCS:  Load the D2FLCS.B50 file into your FLCS. 
                          If you also use a WCS throttle, no program should
                          be loaded into the WCS.

     * Thrustmaster TQS:  Load D2TQS.B50 into your FLCS.  This will
                          automatically configure your TQS for DESCENT II.
                          Follow directions above to configure your throttle
                          entry in DESCENT II.

         Gravis Phoenix:  Load the DESCENT2.PHX file into your Phoenix. In
                          DESCENT II, choose "Joystick" under Options/Controls.
                          Now choose "Configure Above" and change the
                          THROTTLE entry to respond to the throttle
                          slider (the Y2 axis).

      Logitech Cyberman:  You must have the Cyberman MOUSE.COM driver loaded
                          before you run DESCENT II.  If you have a standard
                          mouse connected as well, you will need to use the
                          "/dual" option when you load MOUSE.COM.  See
                          Cyberman docs for details.  

       NoteBook GamePort: Run DESCENT II with the -JoyBios command line switch
                          and everything should work like normal.  Make sure
                          that you have the joystick TSR installed.

Calibration Note:  When using one of the analog throttles listed here or
                   the CH Flightstick, you will be prompted to calibrate
                   your throttle as well as your joystick.

*  >> NOTE TO WCS and FLCS USERS:  Because these devices intercept the
      keyboard signals, your ship may fly strangely when you also hold down
      keyboard keys (like 'A' and 'Z').  If you keep the WCS or FLCS on
      your system, it's recommended that you use those devices for throttle
      control and sliding, not the keyboard.

                          ÈÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¼

The version of Descent II for the S3 Virge chipset is shipped as a
seperate executable.  During installation, you will be asked if you
want to install the S3 version.  

If you have installed the S3 version, run Descent II on your Virge 
card, by typing:

   d2v

Note that the current S3 executable is version 1.1.  Features new to
version 1.2 are not present in the S3 version.
   
If you run Windows 3.1 before running Descent II/Virge, you may 
experience graphics problems when you run Descent II/Virge.  If you
experience this, reboot your computer and rerun Descent II.

The S3 Virge version is a DOS executable.  If you want to run under 
Windows 95, please make sure you have done the following:

    - Go into the Control Panel/System/Performance/File System/CD-ROM
      dialog.  First, make sure the Supplemental Cache Size is set to
      Large.  Secondly, if you have a 2x CD-ROM drive, make sure the
      Optimize Access Pattern dialog is set to "Double Speed Drives"
      (if you have a 4x CD, use "Quad Speed Drives", etc.).  This will
      ensure good movie playback.

    - The DOS shell from which you run Descent II/Virge must have the
      correct memory settings.  Bring up the Properties menu, and 
      select the Memory tab.  Under "MS-DOS protected-mode {DPMI}
      memory", select 16384.  If you create an icon to run Descent
      ii/Virge, be sure to make this change to the icons properties.

Other Win95 items:

    - DESCENT II normally uses the PrintScreen key to take screenshots of
      the game.  If you wish for this key to function in the normal fashion,
      go to the Properties/Windows Shortcut Keys dialog.  Make sure the
      checkbox next to "PRTSC" is enabled.  This will restore the Win95
      default setting for this key.

    - Disable any screen savers you have running.  These will interrupt
      gameplay and possibly cause it to lock-up.

    - If you get an "HMI Driver Not Found" error, you should simply
      re-start DESCENT II.

    - Do not switch to another program while running Descent II/Virge.
      This could cause Descent II/Virge to become unstable.
