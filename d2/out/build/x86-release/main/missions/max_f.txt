Descent- Maximum
     and...
Descent- Maximum Anarchy
brought to you by Jeff250
originally by Parallax Software

Descent- Maximum was a game originally released for the Playstation.
Although its similarities to Descent 2 were striking, it did feature unique
levels, although generally smaller and simpler.  The 24 level (plus 6 secret
level) campaign was intended to parallel the same Descent 2 plot, although
movies and such could not be implemented in this PC version of the game due to
limitations with custom campaigns.  Likewise, Descent- Maximum also included a
6 level anarchy campaign for one on one action.

After out-of-curiosity purchasing Descent- Maximum (despite the fact I didn't
own a Playstation), I wondered if it were possible to bring the same levels
to PC.  I noticed that, like all other Descent's, this one also included a Hog
file, but, unfortunately, this one was not like others in format.  Fortunately,
the format was easy enough to figure out, and I wrote a small program to
extract the contents.  I made with them what I could, and what is included in
this zip is the product of my endeavors, the PC campaign of Descent- Maximum.

Other modifications I performed are as follows:
 * Added 2 (up to 4-- max) coop players in the Descent- Maximum single player
   campaign
 * Added 6 (up to 8-- max) anarchy players in the Descent- Maximum Anarchy
   campaign
 * Added custom briefing interplay to simulate the original experience

This Descent- Maximum port has been tested on the DOS Descent2 exe, the
Win95 Descent2 exe, and D2x 1.3.27.  Although no problems are known, they may
exist, and I am not responsible for any harm that may come to anything as a
result.

Email any bugs to jeff250@gmx.net.

Enjoy!


Addendum by Ryusei117
=====================

This is a modified version of Jeff250's Descent Maximum port. The following
changes were made:

	* Corrected the names of all levels. The level names in the original
	  version were different from the level names in the PlayStation game.
	* Removed all of the pre-placed mines, since they don't exist in the
	  PlayStation game. Strangely, the mines are present in the level files
	  on the PlayStation game's disc, but do not appear in the game itself.
	* Fixed a few problems with the briefing images, such as brightly-
	  colored backgrounds on the "Prepare for Descent..." screens and green
	  stars in the Zeta Aquilae image.
	* Switched the mission type of the Anarchy mission. It now appears in
	  the mission list only when hosting a multiplayer game.
	* Changed the file names and mission names to distinguish this version
	  from the original version when hosting and joining multiplayer games.
	  This also allows players to install both versions in the same folder.

Please note that this version of Descent Maximum is incompatible with Jeff250's
original version because of the corrected level names. All players in a
multiplayer game will need the same version.

Many thanks to the following people:

	* pip5528 from the Descent Mission Database for removing the pre-placed
	  mines.
	* ThugsRook from the DXX-Rebirth forum for fixing briefing problems
	* Yarn from the DXX-Rebirth forum for extracting the Anarchy-level names
	  from the PlayStation game and fixing briefing problems
	* Jeff250 for porting the levels
	* And of course, everyone at Parallax Software for creating Descent
	  Maximum
