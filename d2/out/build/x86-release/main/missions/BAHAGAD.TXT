                Descent II Add-On Mission  

IMPORTANT NOTE: Descent II Vertigo Enhanced is NOT required
to play Bahagad Outbreak.

Introduction:

Bahagad Outbreak is the continuation to the Kragg 
mission, Bahagad Outbreak contains many features including:
 *8 mission-oriented/key-based levels
 *4 new (sort of) polygon models
 *6 new enemies and over 18 different robot behaviors
 *Custom MIDI soundtrack
 *Full briefings and Vertigo backgrounds

NOTES: There are two modes to Bahagad Outbreak:
 *The easy-cheesy mode with Descent 1 robots and weapons.
 *The normal mode with Descent 2 robots and weapons.
Differences:
-Bahagad EASYMODE:
 *Only Descent 1 robots (which are really easy to beat)
 *Only Descent 1 weapons (Since you are facin Descent 1 robots, might
  as well make it fair for the robots)
 *No briefings (since you chose the easy path, we won't give you the
  full in-depth story!)
 *No new music
 *No secret levels (yes, it is true, you can find the exits, but there
  will be no secret levels, again, you chose the easy mode!)
 *None of the new bosses (the two new bosses won't appear and only
  bosses 1 and 2 of Descent 1 will take their place!)

-Bahagad NORMALMODE:
 *Lots of Descent 2 robots!
 *Lots of Descent 2 weapons!
 *Full in-depth briefings! (runs 25 pages in length when printed out!)
 *New Music soundtrack!
 *Only three thief bots!
 *Both secret levels!
 *New bosses and new enemies!
 *Much harder too!
 *Finally can see the real ending!

Thank you all again!


Notes: This mission is not for the faint of heart, it is quite tough, so
stay alert! Also, if you did the medium or minimal install option for Descent2,
I highly suggest you keep the CD-ROM in your drive throughout your playing
in Bahagad, because the breifings will come up and sometimes require robot movies
that are on the CD. Unless you did large or crazy install, then you just 
need the CD-ROM just to start the game.
