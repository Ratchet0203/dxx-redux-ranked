ANACHRONISTIC
v1.1 - 2023-10-23 (v1.0 - 2023-09-05)
By AlumiuN (ctalyst666@gmail.com)

A small set of three (hopefully (again)) vanilla-compatible levels for
Descent 1, built over the course of a year or so on-and-off (turns out I really
prefer building geometry to populating levels :P).

Curse Of The Red River - named after Barren Earth's excellent album, a
    facility built around and on top of a river of lava, with plenty of
    shortcuts to keep backtracking to a minimum.

Sick Transit - a play on the phrase "sic transit gloria mundi", a material
    transport hub after a catastrophic failure that filled a number of passages
    with both caved-in rock and highly viscous toxic waste. Don't lick the
    green stuff.

Appeasement Refinery - a large refinery and accompanying geothermal facility,
    with a name that really only results in more questions than answers.

Many thanks to ProxyOne, for his excellent Inferno editor, and everyone from
the r/Descent and Descent Developer Discords for their support.

v1.1 - Small adjustments to Curse Of The Red River, including slightly less cursed geometry
       Fixes to triggers in Sick Transit and Appeasement Refinery to fix warnings/rare crashes in Rebirth (and probably other ports)
