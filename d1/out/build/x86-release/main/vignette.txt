Description:	A fun 25 level + 2 secret level set that focuses mainly on strong, fast, challenging 
		gameplay and a bunch of robots to blast! Each level centers around a central theme
		and doesn't deviate much from that theme. Furthermore, there is at least one room
		in each level where you can have a good all-out dogfight with a bunch of robots! Finally,
		the secret level exits are on level 11 and level 19. Leave the reactor room and search
		for newly opened areas once the reactor is blown to find these secret exits. Beware
		though, these secret levels are insanely rough! Enjoy the set!
